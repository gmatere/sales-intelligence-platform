# Known limitations

Deliberate trade-offs and open weaknesses in this system, by layer. Written as
it was built rather than reconstructed afterwards, so the reasoning is honest
about what was a considered decision versus what was a time constraint.

## Ingest (`ingest/ingest.py`)

**[risk] Shortest-domain-wins is a heuristic for entity ownership.**
`primary_domain()` picks the shortest registrable domain across a host's
hostnames. A host presenting `["cdn.acme.com", "x.io"]` resolves to `x.io`
purely because it is shorter, even if Acme owns the asset. Shortest is a proxy
for "closest to the apex", not a correct ownership rule. This is the specific
gap the LLM entity-classification layer exists to cover, and the reason
classification precision is the metric that matters most.

**[trade-off] Resume discards the in-flight shard.**
State is derived from the filesystem (count of completed shards) rather than a
separate state file, so there is nothing to drift out of sync. Cost: dying at
record 450,000 loses the 50,000 rows buffered since the last flush. Acceptable
for a job that runs twice.

**[fixed] Resume could silently skip a shard's worth of records.**
The first implementation wrote each shard directly to its final filename.
Parquet writes its footer last, so a crash mid-write left a truncated file on
disk — which the resume glob counted as complete, skipping 100,000 records
that were never saved. Found by accident: reading the output directory during
a run raised `No magic bytes found at end of file part-00006.parquet`, which
is the same truncated state a crash would leave behind.

Fixed by writing to `.part-NNNNN.inflight` (excluded from the resume glob) and
atomically renaming on completion. An interrupted run now leaves an ignored
temp file rather than a fake-complete shard.

**[trade-off] Resume arithmetic assumes every existing shard is full.**
`shard_index * SHARD_SIZE` over-counts whenever the final shard is partial.
With atomic writes the dangerous case is gone, and what remains is benign: re-
running an already-complete ingest over-skips and does nothing. Observed as
`skipping 9,000,000` against 8,914,693 actual records. It would matter only if
the source grew between runs (an appended feed rather than a snapshot), which
this design does not support. A per-shard row count in a manifest would close
it properly.

**[trade-off] Single-threaded parse.**
One core handles all 8.8M records. Parallelising requires splitting the zstd
frame, which is not cheaply seekable. For a source read twice, the simple
version wins; a recurring pipeline would pre-split the input.

**[trade-off] `scanned_at` carried as a string.**
Cast happens in dbt staging so ingest stays a pure projection. Cost: no
time-based pruning at the Parquet layer. Irrelevant for a single snapshot,
wrong for an incremental feed.

**[gap] ~26% of records have no resolvable domain.**
They are excluded from entity grouping rather than attributed by IP or ASN.
Returning `NULL` instead of inventing a fallback is deliberate — a wrong
entity anchor is worse than a missing one — but it does mean a
quarter of the raw data never reaches the prospect list.
